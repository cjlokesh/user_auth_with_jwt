# Project Title

## Backend application to validate credentials based on JWT Tokens


- The application uses a database.sqlite file which has a single User table
- The user table has a username and encrypted password
- On the login request, the application validates the users credentials with stored user credentials on the database
- Based on the validation it depends on whether the user can access the protected APIs or not
- database.sqLite is generated by running the create_db.js file present in the application root directory
- The database.sqLite can be examined by visiting the page https://sqliteviewer.app/
- The application can be tested with basic UI served by the application or using exposed postman collection
- On valid user credentials, the server responds with JWT Token or Error response message
